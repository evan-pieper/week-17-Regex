# A Basic Introduction to Functional Regular Expressions

In basic terms, regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. They provide a powerful tool for searching, replacing, and parsing text with complex criteria. They use a blend of special characters and constructs to define search parameters.
In web development, colors are often represented using hexadecimal notation. This document delves into a regular expression specifically designed to match hexadecimal color codes, which can be either 3-digit or 6-digit long, and may or may not start with a ‘#’. The regex that performs this operation is as follows:
```
 /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/.
```
This document will explain each component of this regex and how it works to match a hexadecimal color code.

## Summary

This article seeks to inform the user of the basic components of a regular expression and how they can be used to match character combinations in strings. It will cover the following topics: anchors, quantifiers, grouping constructs, bracket expressions, character classes, the OR operator, flags, and character escapes.

## Regex Components
There are two basic types of regex characters. Literal characters are the simplest. They are characters that match only and exclusively themselves. For example, the regex /d/ will match the character ‘d’, but not the character 'D'. The other type of component is a metacharacter. Metacharacters are special characters that have a unique meaning within a regular expression. For example, the regex /./ will match any character except for a newline. The \d metacharacter matches any digit character, and the \w metacharacter matches any alphanumeric character.

### Anchors
In the regex 
```
/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/
```
, the ^ and $ characters are anchors. The ^ character asserts the position at the start of a line, and the $ asserts the position at the end of a line. Together, they denote a string of characters or quantifiers that must be matched exactly. In this case, the ^ and $ characters are used to ensure that the regex matches the entire string, and not just a substring.

### Quantifiers
The ? in #? is a quantifier that matches 0 or 1 occurrence of the preceding element, making the ‘#’ optional. {6} and {3} are also quantifiers, matching exactly 6 and 3 occurrences of the preceding character classes respectively. The | character is an OR operator that matches either the expression to the left or the expression to the right. In this case, it matches either the 6-digit or 3-digit hex code.

### Grouping Constructs
( and ) are used to create a capturing group. This groups the 6-digit and 3-digit patterns together, allowing the OR operator to work correctly. The capturing group also allows the regex to return the matched hex code, rather than the entire string.

### Character Classes

### The OR Operator

### Flags
