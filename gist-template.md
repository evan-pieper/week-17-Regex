# A Basic Introduction to Functional Regular Expressions

In basic terms, regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. They provide a powerful tool for searching, replacing, and parsing text with complex criteria. They use a blend of special characters and constructs to define search parameters.
In web development, colors are often represented using hexadecimal notation. This document delves into a regular expression specifically designed to match hexadecimal color codes, which can be either 3-digit or 6-digit long, and may or may not start with a ‘#’. The regex that performs this operation is as follows:
```
 /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/.
```
This document will explain each component of this regex and how it works to match a hexadecimal color code.

## Summary

This article seeks to inform the user of the basic components of a regular expression and how they can be used to match character combinations in strings. It will cover the following topics: anchors, quantifiers, grouping constructs, bracket expressions, character classes, the OR operator, flags, and character escapes.
